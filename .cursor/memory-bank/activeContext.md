# Active Context

## Current Focus
The current focus is on building the foundation of the website with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We have implemented a basic responsive structure with clean, semantic markup and modular CSS following best practices.

## Recent Changes

- Set up project documentation
- Built HTML structure for homepage, about page, and contact page
- Implemented responsive CSS using mobile-first approach
- Created JavaScript for mobile menu, smooth scrolling, and form validation
- Added SVG icons and placeholder images
- Implemented basic accessibility features

## Next Steps
1. Create additional pages (services, etc.)
2. Add more interactive elements
3. Enhance accessibility features
4. Implement SEO optimizations
5. Add more content and real images
6. Test across different browsers and devices
7. Optimize for performance

## Active Decisions
- **HTML Structure**: Using semantic HTML5 elements for better accessibility and SEO
- **CSS Approach**: Implemented a mobile-first responsive design with CSS variables
- **JavaScript**: Using vanilla JavaScript for better performance and avoiding unnecessary dependencies
- **Color Scheme**: Selected a blue primary color with complementary secondary colors
- **Layout**: Using a clean, minimal layout with plenty of whitespace

## Current Challenges
- Need to finalize all page designs
- Form submission handling needs proper implementation
- Image placeholders need to be replaced with real content
- Some responsive layout issues may need refinement
- Need to add more interactive elements for engagement

## Open Questions
- Analytics integration requirements
- Progressive enhancement strategy for older browsers
- Image optimization approach for different screen sizes
- Performance optimizations for script loading
- Additional accessibility testing requirements
